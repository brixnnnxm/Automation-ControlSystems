# Automated Control System for RHEED Capture Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è
This project was a Senior Design capstone at Western Michigan University for the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences: Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. The students responsible are Brianna Murphy and Joseph Williams.

## üí°About This Project
Molecular beam epitaxy is a process used for creating thin films of single-crystal materials for manufacturing semiconductors and nanotechnology structures. During the molecular beam epitaxy process, reflection high-energy electron diffraction capture analysis is utilized to acquire information about the surface of the substrate, including roughness, structural properties, and growth rate. Before completion of this project, this sensitive and potentially dangerous process is being controlled manually in a local research facility. Although this has been performed by trained professionals, there is always the presence of human error which leads to inaccurate results and potential safety hazards. For this project, an automated system was designed and constructed to perform each part of this task and provide the user with accurate results. A microcontroller was programmed to control 1) a servo motor custom mounted on the shutter knob, 2) a stepper motor to actuate the sample rotation knob, 3) triggering the capture camera, 4) trajectory of the electron beam gun upon the sample, and 5) sending of the images to the lab computer. This computer used a machine learning program that verified the quality of the image and displayed the resulting classification on a user interface. Additionally, safety measures including manual and digital stop features, warning lights embedded in the control station, and security codes implemented within the user interface have been set in place to mitigate hazards and prevent accidents. This automated system has improved the overall efficiency and safety of performing this task as well as improved the precision and accuracy of results.
